# My-Projects

This repository is a compilation of my programming projects, showcasing the different languages I have learned and practiced throughout my coding journey. It contains projects in C and C++, where I have explored fundamental programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms. In Python, I have worked on scripts, small applications, and problem-solving exercises to strengthen my logic and versatility.

Alongside these, I have also created projects in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on building responsive web pages, interactive designs, and experimenting with the core principles of web development. Each project demonstrates not only the technical skills Iâ€™ve gained but also my dedication to improving and expanding my knowledge across multiple programming domains.

This repository will continue to grow as I learn new technologies and work on more projects, making it a reflection of both my progress and passion for programming.
